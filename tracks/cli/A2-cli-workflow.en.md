After installing a CLI and running first tasks, the next question: **how do I make the CLI consistent, repeatable, shareable?** This stop covers workflow patterns — turning "I retype the same prompt every time" into "set it up once, the CLI does the right thing automatically".

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Write a practical `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` — the minimum practical shape is **(1) role** + **(2) project context** + **(3) forbidden actions** + **(4) test commands** + **(5) delivery format**. In practice, 30-50 lines can usually cover those 5 things; beyond 50 lines, split the file
- Design repeatable slash commands / custom prompts
- Decompose multi-step tasks into ones the CLI can execute end-to-end
- Design prompts portable across CLIs

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise CLI-5: Write production CLAUDE.md
Your CLAUDE.md should at minimum contain:
- **Persona**: "You're a senior Python engineer / academic writing assistant / etc."
- **Repo context**: what project, what stack, what conventions
- **Don't do**: don't touch main, don't move secrets, don't auto-commit
- **How to do things**: plan first, run tests before commit, use type hints
- **Common commands**: how to run tests, lint, deploy

Commit it to git. Next time a teammate clones the repo, their Claude Code auto-loads your conventions.

### Exercise CLI-6: First slash command
Write `.claude/commands/review.md` (or your CLI's equivalent):
```markdown
---
name: review
description: Review staged changes for security + style
---

Run this flow:
1. `git diff --cached` to get staged changes
2. Look for: hard-coded secrets, SQL injection, type errors
3. Check against the style rules in CLAUDE.md
4. Output: PASS / or list of specific changes needed
```
After this, every `/review` runs the same flow.

### Exercise CLI-7: Multi-step task decomposition
Give the CLI a complex task ("translate these 50 markdown files to English + add frontmatter + move to en/ subdirectory").
- First time: throw the whole task at it → observe how it does it, where it errs
- Second time: pre-decompose into 5 sub-tasks, give them one by one → observe the difference
- Lesson: the CLI is like you — too-big tasks need decomposition; too-small tasks lead to over-orchestration

> ⭐ **Advanced note: Claude Code native multi-agent mechanisms** (read this one sentence for now; no need to expand it in A2): the manual sub-task splitting in CLI-7 can be automated with Claude Code's **Subagent / Agent team / Background agent** mechanisms. The full explanation, exercises, and when-not-to-use guidance (team permissions, context isolation, and result-review flow all matter) are in **[Stage 5.5](../../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#55--subagents-claude-codes-native-multi-agent-mechanism--2025-new-feature)**.

### Exercise CLI-8: Portable prompt
Write a prompt that works in Claude Code. **Run the same prompt in Codex / OpenCode / Gemini CLI** — what needs to change? Common discoveries:
- file path conventions differ (cwd vs absolute)
- shell execution permission defaults differ
- "plan-first" prompting needs explicit instructions in some, default in others

Compile these into your own cheat sheet.

### Recommended Tools

- [**yamadashy/repomix**](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ★ 26k+ — Packs your entire codebase into a single AI-friendly file (XML / Markdown / JSON) for Claude Code / Codex code review / refactoring. Includes MCP server mode + tree-sitter compression (compression varies by language and file structure) + secretlint for secret filtering. **A must-have, daily-driver-grade tool for Track A.**
- [**langchain-ai/openwiki**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openwiki) ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ★ 13k+ — CLI that generates and auto-maintains a wiki of your codebase, then wires a reference into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` so your coding agent reads it on demand and it stays updated as code changes. `npm i -g openwiki` → `openwiki --init`. Built on DeepAgents, traces to LangSmith. MIT.

> 💡 **Concept: *agent-facing documentation*.** repomix and OpenWiki attack the same gap (your agent doesn't know the repo) from two angles: a one-shot packed snapshot vs a living, auto-maintained wiki. The shared move is to give the agent *structured codebase context it reads on demand*, kept separate from your `CLAUDE.md` instructions rather than crammed into the prompt.

## ✅ Self-Check Before A3

Can you:

- [ ] Written at least 1 CLAUDE.md for a production / work repo (not a demo repo)
- [ ] Written at least 2 slash commands you actually use
- [ ] Run the same prompt across 2 different CLIs and know the differences
- [ ] Articulate "what tasks should be decomposed vs not"

If yes → proceed to [A3 — Integration & Production](A3-cli-production.en.md).

If no → CLAUDE.md only on demo repos is wasted; go write one for your real repo first.

## 💡 Common Pitfalls

- **CLAUDE.md too long**: over 100 lines and the CLI auto-truncates / ignores the back half. Sweet spot: 30-60 lines.
- **Slash command written as "do X, Y, Z, A, B" in one sentence**: CLIs skip steps. Rewrite as numbered list with a success criterion per step.
- **Over-portable**: each CLI has its own strengths; don't strip a prompt of specifics just to make it cross-CLI.
- **"I already know all this, I don't need to write it"**: CLAUDE.md is for future you (and new team members), not for current you.
